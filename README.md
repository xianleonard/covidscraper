# Outlook COVID Scraper

**This project was discontinued and archived on June 1, 2022.**

The Outlook News Group's COVID-19 case and death data scraper, which automatically scrapes the [Los Angeles County Department of Public Health website](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/locations.htm) every hour and adds it to a CSV file. Currently, the automation only scrapes data for Glendale and Burbank cities.

A separate CSV file containing minor analyses for the Burbank data (new cases tracker and a seven-day moving average) is also produced.

Data collected prior to Jan. 11, 2022, (valid_thru = 2022/01/09) was scrapped manually. No entries for Glendale were collected.

Data is visualized via Flourish and published [here](https://outlooknewspapers.com/blog/2021/11/30/burbank-covid-19-dashboard/).

The scraper was made by Christian Leonard, senior staff writer at the Outlook News Group.
